## Timeline

### [980POC 23/4 3:00] Comfort's Birth

Comfort was born to two Cind parents, his mother, named "Peace," and his father, "Guidance."

His father was the spiritual leader of the Dustborn clan, dubbed "Father Seeker," and therefore, Comfort was also destined from birth to lead his kin into a golden age of safety and prosperity through spiritual enlightenment; he was a prince, of sorts. Peace, on the other hand, held the title of "Mother Protector," a role tasked with the burden of raising and protecting the child of the Father Seeker. Unfortunately, Guidance had to leave very early in Comfort's life to go on a vision-quest of enlightenment, an ancient bending pilgrimage to the four temples of the elements across The Blightlands, meaning Comfort's childhood was mainly spent with his mother.

### [993POC 23/4 18:00] Disaster Strikes

On his 13th birthday, the migrant convoy of caravans Comfort called home was raided by a demon horde.

The guardians of the clan, legendary warriors called The Storm-Breakers, faced-down the demonic force directly, armed only with their master-crafted Qinglong Ji Polearms and Jian Swords, they were able to repel most of the attacking horde. However, some individual demons were able to break through, completely ignoring the runes of protection that were placed behind The Storm-Breakers' defensive line. This alone was enough to catch the caravans completely off-guard and multiple families were completely destroyed in the massacre that followed.

Comfort felt a tremendous sense of responsibility as he heard his friends and their families crying out, and had to force himself free from his mother's arms to leave their hiding spot. He ran towards the closest caravan that had a demon assaulting it and used the only real techniques he was ever taught, firebolt and fireskin, to hurt the demon enough to make it retreat. But, upon looking into the caravan, he was immediately attacked by the very friend he was trying to save. Using a chef's knife, the other young Cinds slashed at Comfort, inflicting enough damage to make him fall unconscious.

This is the last thing Comfort remembers clearly about that day, but to his ignorance, Guidance, Comfort's father, returned to the clan on the day of the attack and, armed with his new enlightened knowledge of the secrets of elemental bending, single-handedly protected the rest of the caravans shortly after Comfort fell. His father, using "The Light" to bend the very energy of the world itself, redirected Comfort's soul during its transition to the ethereal plane and guided it safely back into his body, forever cursing his father by stripping him of all elemental bending abilities, whilst planting the seed of enlightenment within his now-revived child. Still unconscious, Comfort was taken by his parents to an ancient gateway to the material plane, where he was left with ample supplies to start his life anew in a world where his clan would not follow and potentially hunt him.
