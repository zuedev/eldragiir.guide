## Timeline

### [980POC 23/4 3:00] Comfort's Birth

Comfort was born to two Cind parents, his mother, named "Peace," and his father, "Guidance."

His father was the spiritual leader of the Dustborn clan, bearing the title of "Father Superior." This title was hereditary, and therefore, Comfort was also destined from birth to lead his kin through spiritual enlightenment; he was a prince, of sorts. Peace, Comfort's mother, held the title of "Mother Protector," a role tasked with the responsibility of raising and protecting the child of the current Father Superior.

Unfortunately, Guidance had to leave very early in Comfort's life to go on a vision-quest of enlightenment, an ancient tradition that involved a pilgrimage to the four temples of the elements across The Blightlands, meaning Comfort's childhood was mainly spent with his mother.

On his 13th birthday, the migrant convoy of caravans Comfort called home was atatcked by a horde of demons.

The guardians of the clan, a band of legendary warriors called The Storm-Breakers, left the caravan to intercept the demonic force. However, some lowly demons were able to break through after dispelling the runes of protection that were placed behind The Storm-Breakers' defensive line. This alone was enough to catch the caravans completely off-guard and multiple families were killed in the massacre that followed.

Comfort heard his friends and their families crying out, and had to force himself free from his mother's arms to leave their hiding spot. He ran towards the closest caravan that had a demon assaulting it and used the only real techniques he was ever taught, firebolt and fireskin, to hurt the demon enough to make it retreat. But, upon looking into the caravan, he was immediately attacked by the very friend he was trying to save. Using a chef's knife, the other young Cinds slashed at Comfort, inflicting enough damage to make him fall unconscious.

This is the last thing Comfort remembers clearly about that day, but to his ignorance, Guidance, Comfort's father, returned to the clan on the day of the attack and, armed with his new knowledge of the elements, single-handedly protected the rest of the caravans shortly after Comfort fell. His father used a powerful spell to return Comfort's soul to it's body, forever cursing his father by stripping him of all his magic. Still unconscious, Comfort was taken to an ancient gateway to the material plane by The Storm-Breakers under instruction of Guidance, where he was left with ample supplies to start his life anew in a world that was not cursed with Blight.
