prose: >-
  Eca is an ancient martial art that allows the practitioner to alter the
  elements of earth, water, fire, and air to manifest exceptional effects akin
  to magic. In order to manifest these effects, one must use a specific mixture
  of semantic gestures and vocal cues called "Eca techniques".
