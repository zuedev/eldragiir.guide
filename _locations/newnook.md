## Prose

Newnook is a small hamlet town situated in the center of the southern-most island of Gil'brun, Generas. Located just east of Rivenhood, The town doesn't have much to offer and is more widely used as a stopping point for adventurers traveling between other more interesting places of Generas. The only amenities it features are a lavish adventuring tavern and a public bathhouse that the residents refer to as the only real reason they choose to stay in town.
