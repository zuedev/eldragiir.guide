# The Empire

## Introduction

The Empire is a mighty faction that spans most of the civilised land of the material plane. The Empire was initially created to unite man and orc under one banner but has grown to include nearly all sentient humanoid races of the material realm. The Emperor, the ultimate authority throughout the Empire, is considered an immortal being that has transcended to be a demigod. He is both loved and feared by the common folk, considered to be an all-judging deity sent to unite all under the Empire's flag.

## History

The Emperor, also known as Willcock the Impenetrable, was an acolyte of Braetos, the God of War. After being banished by his own for crimes untold, he received a vision by his god, depicting the end of days and instructing Willcock to go on a conquest to unite the territories of the material plane before it was too late. Willcock immediately began his crusade, starting with the orc tribes of the wastelands, toppling their war chiefs and instilling his own rule. Using the raw natural strength of the orcs to kickstart his army with the powerful muscle he needed to compete against the established forces of the wastelands.

Using his new orc-based army, Willcock was able to start aiding the local villages with their raiding problems, gaining their trust and admiration as a champion of the people. The splintered governments of old didn't stand a chance once he was able to rally a considerable amount of human warriors to his side. Consequently, his power grew ever greater until he became so powerful that entire regions would allow his forces to move through their lands and recruit more soldiers to their cause without resistance. It was around this time that the Palace Imperialis had begun construction in Higher Valrian.

The expansion of the Empire continued under Willcock's reign until the Great Cataclysm, which saw hordes of demons tearing through the Empire's lands. It is rumoured that around this time, the Emperor was given one more vision by Braetos of how he could seal the rift that allowed demons to pour into the material plane, as well as the power to do so. Willcock, along with his most trusted guard, the Endictus Emperiortis, rode for the Throat of the World, a grand mountain known to be the tallest in all of the material plane. It was there where the Endictus Emperiortis fought the Five-Nights Battle, a bloody and epic battle between the forces of the material plane and the demonic hordes of the Otherworld. It is said that, during the last moments of the fight, the Emperor's sword was shining with the golden light of the Nine as it cut through the hides of demonic lords like a hot knife through butter. On the fifth night of fighting, the Emperor was able to close the rift that allowed the demonic forces of the Otherworld to enter and maintain form in the material plane, forever shutting it off from our world and destroying every demon in the land at once.

Once the Emperor won the battle, bloodied and battered from war, he returned to the Palace Imperialis to sit upon the Eternal Throne one final time. He is now entombed to stay within the Palace Imperialis, for if he were to leave, the powerful magics that maintain his broken body would cease to function, rendering him mortal and allowing his wounds to take his life.
