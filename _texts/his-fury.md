## Summary

An eye-witness account of a chaotic horde attacking Haven, the capital city of The Empire. Our narrator is a legionary sergeant, who describes to us his experience not only fighting the forces of the Torrent, but also his brief encounter with the Emperor himself.

## Content

Facing down the tempestuous hordes of the Torrent, our men stood vigilant and fearless. I was positioned in the third line from the front, acting sergeant of the second company, eighth legion. As the tireless wave of clambering lost souls approached our shield wall, all I could think of in that moment was my family back in Haven, and how I must do all that I could to hold back the tide of chaos that threatened our very existence. I remember the sounds... The banshee-like screeching getting louder with every tense second that passed.

It was then that the warp-hail started to rain down upon us, sudden blasts of warping and corrupting energies designed to break our defense and resolve. With each landing of those blasphemous projectiles I felt the ground shake and my ears cringe at the sudden wave of cold piercing noise that entered my mind.
