## Summary

An eye-witness account of a chaotic horde attacking Haven, the capital city of The Empire. Our narrator is a legionary sergeant, who describes to us his experience not only fighting the forces of the Torrent, but also his brief encounter with the Emperor himself.

## Content

Facing down the tempestuous hordes of the Torrent, our men stood vigilant and fearless. I was positioned in the third line from the front, acting sergeant of the second company, eighth legion. As the tireless wave of clambering lost souls approached our shield wall, all I could think of in that moment was my family back in Haven, and how I must do all that I could to hold back the tide of chaos that threatened our very existence. I remember the sounds... The banshee-like screeching getting louder with every tense second that passed.

It was then that the warp-hail started to rain down upon us, sudden blasts of warping and corrupting energies designed to break our defense and resolve. With each landing of those blasphemous projectiles I felt the ground shake and my ears cringe at the sudden wave of a cold, piercing noise attempting to enter my mind. Our company held strong, it was only a few days prior that we saved what remained of the Haven's Regent legions from the first onslaught of these chaotic entities; we were ready for this. I ordered my company to brace, and the men followed suit and moved into a tighter formation before readying their shields. All we could do was wait for that first clash of metal...

The initial wave of demons was fierce, and hit our unit hard. A group of a hundred-so viletters came charging head-first into our line, testing the fortitude of our formation and looking for caps in our defense; they failed to find one. A second charge came crashing in, and I was barking at my men to hold their formation and not allow even the slightest gap between our diresteel towershields. The second line was feeling the pressure from those in front, pushing back against the force with their own shield wall, effectively crushing those unfortunate enough to be holding the front; all the while our flanks were being bombarded by more warp-hail.

It took the viletters a further two charges before we noticed our company's first casualty. We were expanded to double capacity, which brought our numbers from 30 to 90, but only one of our men falling was enough for a break in the formation to take root and break us apart. 3 viletters pushed into the opening before bursting their villainous payloads into our ranks. I tried to regain order and move my legionnaires into the front to repair our formation, but the seething pain now washing over those immediately around the breach forced their bodies to fail. It wasn't long before the viletters gave way to daedrakin, who took full advantage of our broken ranks to start carving apart my brothers before me.

I sounded the horn to break formation and begin combat with the enemy, to which the company suddenly moved to coax the horde into a kill-box. Even with their brethren fallen in the vilest of agony, my legionnaires executed the formation change perfectly, as if the guiding hand of the Emperor himself was pushing them to re-stance and prepare to die for their kingdom. Asphyxiating the enemy force from all sides, our mighty and blessed weaponry cleaved a schism through daedrakin flesh and bone with a holy vengeance. I remember it was as if time itself slowed to allow us to savor our slaughter. My mace knew exactly how to take down these scum of the void, crushing skulls and breaking limbs of those who dared to oppose our right to live. The fire-red crackling of our holy-endowed attacks was going to be the last thing any daedrakin would see before being sent back into the endless deep.
