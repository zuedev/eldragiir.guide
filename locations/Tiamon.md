# Tiamon

## Introduction

Tiamon is the largest and most advanced city in all of the Blightlands. Abandoned by its founders, a Tiefling-only faction known now only as "the Inventors" as history forgot their original name with the fall of Tiamon, the great city is now a relic of a forgotten time of technological advancement in Tiefling lore. Tiamon is now considered uninhabitable, and is home to only automated constructs designed initially to aid the residents of the city, but who now purge the streets and buildings of anything they consider "foreign".

## History

The history of Tiamon is vague and shrouded in mystery, forgotten to time as it's streets were abandoned ages past. What we do know of the city's past is mostly contradictory and considered hearsay, but patterns emerge in the rumours, and there are consistent details between most of the stories.

We know that Tiamon's residents considered the city to be a bastion of safety and prosperity in the ever-changing wastes of the Blightlands, even back then. There are also numerous references to a particular governmental position, the Prince of Fire, a sort of protectorate leader assigned with the responsibility of maintaining the safety of the people of Tiamon as well as their technological prosperity. There were many other similar positions that we know of today, such as the Prince of Water, tasked with agricultural and medical duties, the Prince of Earth, assigned with the responsibilities of construction and mining, and the Prince of Air, a sort of spiritual leader and one tasked with the duty of maintaining the balance and order of all things. Many considered the Prince of Fire, however, to be the ultimate authority over the other cadre of the government.

Though one day, the last known Prince of Fire, named "Ardent" of house Tialek, brought ultimate ruin upon the city, this event came to be known as the Fall of Tiamon and is the reason the residents abandoned the city. The most consistent basis for the Fall of Tiamon was that the recently-developed artificial race, what we now know as the Warforged, began an uprising from within the city's walls against their creators. A great civil war raged throughout Tiamon between the Tieflings and these ancestors of the Warforged, a war that lasted ten years before the Warforged were able to push the remaining Tiefling forces from the city, forcing them to scatter themselves out into the wastes, never to return.

Tiamon now stands idle as roaming bans patrol it's streets, destroying anything that isn't a living metal construct connected to the central hive mind of the automata known as the Custodian. Though all seems lost for the Tiefling race, a new Prince of Fire is prophesied to rise and unite the migrant bands of Tiefling tribes and take back Tiamon in one final warcry of the Tiefling race.
