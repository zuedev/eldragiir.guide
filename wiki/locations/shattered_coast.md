# The Shattered Coast

The Shattered Coast is located north of the [Sands of Woe](sands_of_woe.md). It is called as such for the many small islands and reefs that dot the coastal line at this location. The only safe way for any boat to reach the shoreline safely is to follow the Marius Passage that leads to Cliffport. Only the bravest or foolest of captains attempt to navigate the reefs and shallows along the coast.

## Marius Passage

Marius Passage is the name of the relatively safe passage that leads to the shoreline. It was named after Imperial explorer Marius Vicantius who first made landfall on the Shattered Coast.

## Cliffport

Cliffport was established as an Imperial outpost along the coast. It is a safe place for adventurers who wish to explore deeper south and along the coast. The town has also become a resupply point for vessels travelling up and down the coast. The town is protected by an imperial fortress located on one of the island nearby.
