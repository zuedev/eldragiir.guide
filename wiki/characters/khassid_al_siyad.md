# Master of the Hunt Khassid Al Siyad

Khassid Al Siyad is the Master of the Hunt in the Imperial outpost of Cliffport. He was granted authority over a team of witchers in charge of purging the [Shattered Coast](../locations/shattered_coast.md). His main objective is to make the lands around safe enough for future colonization efforts. 

## Description

Khassid is a half-elf. His skin is brown, tanned by the many years spent outside. His hairs are white and cut very short. His eyes are typical of witcher as they look like cat eyes. He has a neatly trimmed beard. 

His armor is made of leather taken from his many kills : Wyverns, manticores, scorpions... He adorns numerous scars on his body and from which he is greatly proud. On his armour he also wears prominently the symbol of his order and his current title. 

## Personality

Khassid is haughty and proud. He is convinced by his own greatness and few can hope to compete against his hunting skills. Although he shows signs of empathy and compassion toward the fellow members of his team, he sees them more as tools to be used in his hunts.

He despise anyone that claim to be a monster hunter and that is not part of his order as he believes being part of it makes him a cut above anyone else.

Although he is forced to collaborate with the Legion in securing the Shattered Coast, he sees them more as a distraction and often follow his own agenda.
