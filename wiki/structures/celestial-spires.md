# Celestial Spires

Built from a material black as the night, these massive tower run towards the sky with no apparent end. Many have tried to climb or observe the top of such structure but the only thing they were able to find were their own doom.

Their purpose are unknown and forgotten, only those with a deep understanding of the secrets of the universe itself remember why they exist.

## Known Spires and locations

- Spire of Truth (Capital Imperial City)
- Spire of Vigil (Wastes)
- Spire of the Gods (Brightlands)
- The unifinished Spire (Greymouth Bay)
- The Shattered Guardian (Blightlands) 
 
## Purpose

Each spire was built for te only purpose of housing a [Shard of creation](../items/shards-of-creation.md). The strange material and Celestial design of the spire act like an antenna to increase the stabilizing effect of the shard on reality, reinforcing the barrier between the planes and the void. It makes demonic incursions less likely to happen the closer to a spire you get.
