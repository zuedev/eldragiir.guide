# Celestial Spires

The spires are Celestial constructs. Massive towers (1km x 1km base) that reach further than the skies (you can't technically ever reach/see the top of it. The Celestials entrapped the Shards of Creation in those and use the Spire as antennas/relays to stabilize the realms. There are a couple on each plane. Material plane has more than the others.
