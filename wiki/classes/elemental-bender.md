# Elemental Bender
  
## Components Legend

| Key | Value | Details |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| V  | Verbal | A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able to speak in a strong voice. A silence spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to cast. |
| S  | Somantic | A somatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have at least one hand free to provide a somatic component. |
| M  | Material | A material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don’t bother to keep track of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need as long as you have your spell component pouch. |
| F  | Focus | A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch. |
| DF  | Divine Focus | A divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the character’s faith. If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the slash). |
| XP  | XP Cost | Some powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new level, use those XP for casting a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP are treated just like a material component—expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds. |
| C  | Chi | Chi is the special point cost for certain elemental powers. Your Chi is equal to the sum of your Charisma, Dexterity, and Elemental Bender Level, plus how many Chakras you have cleared multiplied by two. In order to use your Chi points, your Chakras must be clear to allow the flow of Chi to run through your body. |

## Class Features

### Powerful Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

### Elemental Redirect
At 2nd level, any time you are hit by a ranged, elemental-based attack (this will apply most often to spells, but counters mundane elements as well), you can roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus. If the result is higher than the attack roll, you are able to redirect the path of the attack within a 160 degree cone behind yourself. If it is equal or lower, you can only redirect it partially within a 45 degree cone behind you and take half damage. This ability works for attacks that require you to make a saving throw as well (such as the Fireball spell). For that, the process is the same, you just follow this process rather than making the saving throw, and the DC of your roll is the save DC, not the attack roll.

### Chi Tapping
At 2nd level, you can tap into your element's key emotion to regain energy. If your chi point total reaches 0, you can roll your Focus Energy die without an action or reaction, and gain that many chi points. You cannot exceed your maximum number of chi points. This die increases as you level up. You must complete a long rest before using this feature again.

### Focus Energy
Whenever you deal elemental damage, you can take a bonus action to deal an extra 1d4 points of whatever elemental damage you deal to your target. This damage will increase as you level up.

### Elemental Block
At 3rd level, any time you are hit by a ranged, elemental-based attack (this will apply most often to spells, but counters mundane elements as well), you can roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus. If the result is higher than the attack roll, you simply take no damage and any splash damage is halved. If it is equal or lower, you take half damage whilst not affacting any splash damage. This ability works for attacks that require you to make a saving throw as well (such as the Fireball spell). For that, the process is the same, you just follow this process rather than making the saving throw, and the DC of your roll is the save DC, not the attack roll.

### Elemental Mastery
This does two things:
1. **Elemental Redirect+:** Same as Elemental Redirect, except if you roll higher than the attack roll, you can choose to spend 1 Chi point to redirect the attack to any other target within the range of the original attack from yourself. If it is equal or lower, you simply redirect it as normal.
2. **Elemental Block+:** Same as Elemental Block, except if you roll higher than the attack roll, you can choose to spend 1 Chi point to gamble "absorbing" the elemental attack for bonus Chi equal to it's spell cast level and no higher than your max Chi points, otherwise you will fail in absorbing the elemental attack and will take half damage of the attack. If it is equal or lower, you simply redirect it as normal.

You can only do either of these once per short rest.

### Traditional Weapon Training
Being an elemental bender, you have mastered the art of using your weapon skills in tandem with your elemental bending. Upon reaching 5th level, when you make an attack with any traditional bending weapons, see table below, you can use a bonus action to do a bending technique that normally takes 1 action.

## Fire Bending (Level 1+)

### Zero-Chi Powers

#### Produce Flame
*Light the way with the light of your fire*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again. You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Dancing Embers
*Create floating embers to light the way*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

#### Control Flames
*Command fire to do your bidding*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour

You choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 10-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways: You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location. You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube. You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour. You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube.

A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren’t being worn or carried.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
