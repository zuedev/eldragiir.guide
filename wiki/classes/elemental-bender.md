## Class Features

### Powerful Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

### Elemental Redirect

At 2nd level, any time you are hit by a ranged, elemental-based attack (this will apply most often to spells, but counters mundane elements as well), you can roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus. If the result is higher than the attack roll, you are able to redirect the path of the attack within a 160 degree cone behind yourself. If it is equal or lower, you can only redirect it partially within a 45 degree cone behind you and take half damage. This ability works for attacks that require you to make a saving throw as well (such as the Fireball spell). For that, the process is the same, you just follow this process rather than making the saving throw, and the DC of your roll is the save DC, not the attack roll.

### Chi Tapping

At 2nd level, you can tap into your element's key emotion to regain energy. If your chi point total reaches 0, you can roll your Focus Energy die without an action or reaction, and gain that many chi points. You cannot exceed your maximum number of chi points. This die increases as you level up. You must complete a long rest before using this feature again.

### Focus Energy

Whenever you deal elemental damage, you can take a bonus action to deal an extra 1d4 points of whatever elemental damage you deal to your target. This damage will increase as you level up.

### Elemental Block

At 3rd level, any time you are hit by a ranged, elemental-based attack (this will apply most often to spells, but counters mundane elements as well), you can roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus. If the result is higher than the attack roll, you simply take no damage and any splash damage is halved. If it is equal or lower, you take half damage whilst not affacting any splash damage. This ability works for attacks that require you to make a saving throw as well (such as the Fireball spell). For that, the process is the same, you just follow this process rather than making the saving throw, and the DC of your roll is the save DC, not the attack roll.

### Elemental Mastery

This does two things:

1.  **Elemental Redirect+:** Same as Elemental Redirect, except if you roll higher than the attack roll, you can choose to spend 1 Chi point to redirect the attack to any other target within the range of the original attack from yourself. If it is equal or lower, you simply redirect it as normal.
2.  **Elemental Block+:** Same as Elemental Block, except if you roll higher than the attack roll, you can choose to spend 1 Chi point to gamble "absorbing" the elemental attack for bonus Chi equal to it's spell cast level and no higher than your max Chi points, otherwise you will fail in absorbing the elemental attack and will take half damage of the attack. If it is equal or lower, you simply redirect it as normal.

You can only do either of these once per short rest.

### Traditional Equipment Training

Being an elemental bender, you have mastered the art of using your own equipment to augment your bending skills, allowing you to use certain armor and weapons in tandem with your elemental bending. Upon reaching 5th level, you are able to do the following:

- When you make an attack with any traditional weapons, you can use a bonus action to do a bending technique that normally takes 1 action.
- When you are hit by an attack and have any traditional armor equipped, you can use a reaction to do a bending technique that normally takes 1 bonus action.
- You also gain mastery with any traditional equipment you use.

### Intense Release

Starting at 5th level, if you are restrained in any way, you can cause your body to reach extremely high temperatures to break the bonds as an action. Metal bonds, like handcuffs, may take several minutes or maybe hours to break, up to the DM. This ability can also be used so that if anyone makes physical contact with you, they will take 1d6 points of Fire damage. This buff lasts for 1 hour, or you can cancel it without taking an action. It can instead be used to create an explosion around you as an action. It has a 15 foot radius centered on you, dealing 6d8 damage to all creatures and objects within the radius besides you. You must complete a long rest before using this feature again.

## Fire Bending (Level 1+)

### Zero-Chi Powers

#### Produce Flame

_Light the way with the light of your fire_

---

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again. You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). This technique can be amplified with chi!

You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube. You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour. You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, C (6)
- **Duration:** Concentration, Up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

### Ten-Chi Powers

#### Earthquake

_Bring the rage of the earth to bare with this one_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Components:** V, S, C (10)
- **Duration:** Concentration, Up to 1 minute

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.
