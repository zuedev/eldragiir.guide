# Heart of Creation

An ancient and forgotten artifact from the time the precursors shaped the universe. Locked away in its own pocket dimension. It contains and radiates the very energy of creation itself. It can shape reality as it weaves and unweaves it around itself.

Shattered during an unknown event. Might have been a rogue precursor (if that is even possible, maybe possible BBEG) or maybe a consequence of what caused the cataclysm, like energy feedback that shattered it. Would need to know what the cause of the cataclysm is.
