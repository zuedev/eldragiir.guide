# Aetherium Core

An aetherium core is a magical device made of charged aetherium. They are used to power other constructs and mechanical devices. Aetherium Cores remain mostly stable but drawing too much power too fast can result in a catastrophic feedback event which will result in the core explosion. The power of the explosion is dependant on the amount of energy stored in the core.
