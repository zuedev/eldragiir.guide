# Shards of Creation

When the heart shattered, some of its shards escaped the pocket dimension and drifted to some of the planes of existence. Without the precursors to help them understanding the nature of it, Celestials gathered some of the shards and use the powers of Creation they hold to stabilize the planes as they started to weaken and the void/warp/chaos started to seep in them.
Celestials in their hubris of declaring themselves protectors of the planes tried to harness that power in massive spires but they didn't truly understood what they were.
The shards need to be brought back to the heart to fix it but only precursors know about the heart and its location.

#### GM NOTES
Stats for the shards: 60ft radius Aura, any creature that is not a demon/fiend, is healed to full and completely restored and rejuvenated. They also immediatly benefit from the effects of a long rest.
Upon physical contact with a human, said human finds himself in a white space with bright silhouettes looking down to him. They talk about him without really listening to what he says if he tried to communicate. They comment on how one of their child seems to have "made it this far" and that he is "not yet ready". "Should we interfere?". "No they need to learn". "Will they make it". "It is not for us to decide".
This happen in a fraction of second. Onlookers only see him briefly touch the shard.
Other creatures than human cannot come closer than 15 feet from the shard
