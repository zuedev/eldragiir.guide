# Rules

We use all standard D&D 5e rules, though we have made some changes for our own games.

## Core Mechanics

### New Ability Score

- **Soul:** This is a measure of your character's ability to uphold their core characteristics, such as their alignment, personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws.
  - **Convertion from corruption:** Take your current corruption and minus it from 18, that is your new Soul ability score.

### Action Economy

Instead of one movement and one action per turn, the player has two general actions that can be "spent" to do the following:

|        Action         |   Cost    |                                 Note                                 |
| :-------------------: | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|         Move          | 1 Action  |                                                                      |
|         Dash          | 2 Actions | 3x current movement speed in one direction, chance to fail (GM roll) |
|        Attack         | 1 Action  |                                                                      |
|     Heavy Attack      | 2 Actions |      Attack w/ advantage, 250% damage if hit, crit-fail if miss      |
|     Cast a Spell      | 1 Action  |                                                                      |
| Cast a Focussed Spell | 2 Actions |   Roll with advantage, 250% potency on success, crit-fail on fail    |
|    Begin Overwatch    | 1 Action  |                      See "Overwatch" rule below                      |

#### Extra Conditions

- Getting a **critical success on initiative rolls** allows the player one more action in their initial turn, whereas a **critical fail** allows them only one action instead. Bonus actions and reactions are not affected.
- The **Extra Attack** feature is changed to a **Combo Attack**, which allows the player to use Extra Attack on one of their attack actions per turn. This still scales with the Fighter higher-level Extra Attack features.

#### Overwatch

**Overwatch** allows the character to prepare an action to trigger once a certain condition is met. Acceptable conditions are:

- A target moves into line of sight of the overwatching character
- A target already within line of sight attempts to do something the overwatching character predefines (e.g. trying to escape, reaching for a sword, etc)
- An entrance/exit within line of sight of the overwatching character is opened/closed (e.g. door opens)

### Health & Death

- When healing someone who's unconscious, you must spend 1 point of healing on the character if they are unstable before applying the rest of the healing.
  - **Example:** You use healing touch on an unstable creature, rolling a total of 9 points of healing, the creature gets back up with 8 health instead of 9.
- **Spare the Dying** now stablizes the target as well as restoring 1 hit point. This spell cannot be used against targets that are not stable.
- Whenever a creature becomes unconscious due to combat, an injury is added to the creature. This can either be dictated by the GM or a roll, and can either be temporary or permanent.
  - Temporary injuries can be fixed through normal healing/restoration. Whereas permanent injuries take multiple days/weeks of healing, or must be performed by high-level magical healing.

## Racial Traits

### Warforged

- The **Constructed Resilience** rule has changed: You still need to sleep, however the exhaustion you receive from not sleeping is more severe.
