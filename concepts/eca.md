title: Eca
description: Eca is an ancient martial art that allows the practitioner to alter
  the   elements of earth, water, fire, and air to manifest exceptional effects
  akin   to magic. In order to manifest these effects, one must use a specific
  mixture   of semantic gestures and vocal cues called "Eca techniques".
