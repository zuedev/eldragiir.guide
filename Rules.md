# Rules

We use all standard D&D 5e rules, though we have made these following changes for our own games:

## Core Mechanics

### Additional Ability Scores

- **Sanity:** To calculate, take the sum of your Wisdom and Intelligence ability scores and half it, rounding down if needed.
- **Honor:** This ability score can only be changed through feats and roleplay actions.
  - Your base "Honor" is set by your initial alignment:
    - **Lawful Good:** 13
    - **Balanced Good:** 12
    - **Chaotic Good or Lawful Neutral:** 11
    - **Balanced Neutral:** 10
    - **Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Evil:** 9
    - **Balanced Evil:** 8
    - **Chaotic Evil:** 7

### Additional Statistic Trackers

- **Corruption:** This statistic keeps track of how corrupted your character is and how easily tempted they can be by ruinous powers. It can only be changed through roleplay actions.
  - **When doing a "corruption check":** Roll a D20, if the result is equal to or lower than your current "corruption" score then you fail, you succeed if the result is higher. Critical fails/successes don't exist for this check.

### Action Economy

Instead of one movement and one action per turn, the player has two general actions that can be "spent" to do the following:

|        Action         |   Cost    |                                         Note                                         |
| :-------------------: | :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|         Move          | 1 Action  |                                                                                      |
|         Dash          | 2 Actions |         2.5x base movement speed in one direction, chance to fail (GM roll)          |
|        Attack         | 1 Action  |                                                                                      |
|     Heavy Attack      | 2 Actions | Attack w/ advantage, roll damage twice if hit, crit-fail if miss, GM flavour\* added |
|     Cast a Spell      | 1 Action  |                                                                                      |
| Cast a Focussed Spell | 2 Actions |    Roll with advantage, 1.25-2.5x potency on success (GM roll), crit-fail on fail    |
|    Begin Overwatch    | 1 Action  |                              See "Overwatch" rule below                              |

_\*GM flavour is situation specific, but is usually extra flair added to action result, dictated by a secret roll_

#### Extra Conditions

- Getting a **critical success on initiative rolls** allows the player one more action in their initial turn, whereas a **critical fail** allows them only one action instead. Bonus actions and reactions are not affected.
- The **Extra Attack** feature is changed to a **Combo Attack**, which allows the player to use Extra Attack on one of their attack actions per turn. This still scales with the Fighter higher-level Extra Attack features.

#### Overwatch

**Overwatch** allows the character to prepare an action to trigger once a certain condition is met. Acceptable conditions are:

- A target moves into line of sight of the overwatching character
- A target already within line of sight attempts to do something the overwatching character predefines (e.g. trying to escape, reaching for a sword, etc)
- An entrance/exit within line of sight of the overwatching character is opened/closed (e.g. door opens)

**NOTE:** The GM may require a roll for this action to succeed depending on the circumstance or may fail it if the situation requires it.

### Health & Death

- When healing someone who's unconscious, you must spend 1 point of healing on the character if they are unstable before applying the rest of the healing.
  - **Example:** You use healing touch on an unstable creature, rolling a total of 9 points of healing, the creature gets back up with 8 health instead of 9.
- **Spare the Dying** now stablizes the target as well as restoring 1 hit point. This spell cannot be used against targets that are not stable.
- Whenever a creature becomes unconscious due to combat, an injury is added to the creature. This can either be dictated by the GM or a roll, and can either be temporary or permanent.
  - Temporary injuries can be fixed through normal healing/restoration. Whereas permanent injuries take multiple days/weeks of healing, or must be performed by high-level magical healing.

## Racial Traits

### Warforged

- The **Warforged Resilience** rule has changed: You need to sleep, and you do suffer exhaustion, but magic still can't put you to sleep.
