# Legend: "Three of Six"

## Abstract

A lonely and battered warforged is seen in the Blightlands' wastes, carrying the unconscious(?) body of a Tiefling soldier on his back. Withered and barely functioning, the warforged's chassis type is barely reminiscent of a juggernaut class as pieces of them drag along behind them, one such piece has a number "3" engraved into it. They are walking away from a flaming city, with smoke plumes overhead casting a shadow across the land.
