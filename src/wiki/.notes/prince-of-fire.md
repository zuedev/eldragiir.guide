# The Prince of Fire

## Abstract

- Continuation of Comfort's story from Zyrtex's campaign
  - **Timeline:**
    - After the party disbanded, he returned to the Blightlands and reconnected with his tribe. Using his newly-found power, he was able to thwart a demonic ambush single-handedly, and even strike down a very powerful demon lord of war. This act fulfilled a prophecy handed down for generations, but even with this known, his position was not easily attained as he was an elemental bender and that was shunned by the tribe's elders.
    - He did some stuff to convince the elders to allow him to do his "job" and guide the tribe.
    - He was ale to guide the tribe to the abandoned high-city of the Tieflings, NAME_HERE, and in doing so he earned the absolute loyalty of his people.
    - He brokered a peace between his tribe and the "Custodians", a sect of Warforged that committed themselves to the protection and maintenance of the great city after their war with the Tieflings. Winning their favor by eradicating an evil devil incursion in the higher city, where ancient relics were being defiled for hellish purposes.
    - He was crowned the "prince of fire", an ancient title of great respect for the Tieflings and Warforged alike, essentially a king.
    - Using his new power and fame, he massed a gigantic army of Tieflings, Warforged, and huge war machines forged through his knowledge of elemental bending and stuff he learned from the halfling inventor from his party.
    - He caused a great tear to be forced open between the Blightlands and the Material Plane, of which he pushed his army through to recover something uwu
